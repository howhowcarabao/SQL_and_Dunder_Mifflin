This repository contains the solution to the questions Mikes walks us through in his series of [videos](https://www.mikedane.com/databases/sql/) about database management basics and SQL. I created the data set in Microsoft SQL Server Mangament Studio and downloaded the data into csv files. I then uploaded the csv files into BigQuery (sandbox) to answer Mike's questions. (Note Mike uses MySQL RDMBS throughout his course).

Thanks [@mike_dane](https://twitter.com/mike_dane) and Giraffe Academy for provding this excellent data set and SQL tutorial! üëãüèª
